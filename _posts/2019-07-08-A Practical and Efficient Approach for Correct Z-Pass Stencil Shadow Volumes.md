### Abstract

Shadow volumes are a popular technique to compute pixel-accurate hard shadows in 3D scenes. Many variants exist that trade off accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we present an artifact-free, efficient, and easy-to-implement stencil shadow volume method. We compare our method to established stencil shadow volume techniques and show that it outperforms the alternatives.
